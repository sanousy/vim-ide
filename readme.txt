In order to see the files, show hidden files ( .vimrc, .vim)
in order to activate clipboard functionality you must instakk vim-gtk3 (i.e. sudo apt install vim-gtk3 <CR>)

Please don't forget to rename vim folder to .vim !
It does not need any plugin manager.

This vimrc has been developed on Ubuntu Mate 22.04
vim is different from vi which ships already with ubunutu, so you have to install the following:

INSTALL
========

sudo apt install vim
sudo apt install vim-gtk3

copy .vimrc to your home folder (~)
copy vim to your home folder (~), and then rename it to .vim (instead of vim).

Happy viming! :)
